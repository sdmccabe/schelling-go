# 1-D Schelling Model in Go
This is an implementation of the one-dimensional Schelling segregation model, developed as practice writing ABMs in Go and to test possible optimizations.  It builds on an implementation of the 1-D Schelling model I wrote in Python in early 2015. When writing
that model, I generally adhered to the formalized version of the model described in the following citation:
